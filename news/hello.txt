Introduction

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:

    Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
    Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:

    Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
    Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.
Get started

Here’s how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

We recommend following our Quickstart guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

Note: These docs are for the LangChain Python package. For documentation on LangChain.js, the JS/TS version, head here.
Modules

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:
Model I/O

Interface with language models
Data connection

Interface with application-specific data
Chains

Construct sequences of calls
Agents

Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
Memory

Persist application state between runs of a chain
Callbacks

Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
Examples, ecosystem, and resources
Use cases

Walkthroughs and best-practices for common end-to-end use cases, like:

    Chatbots
    Answering questions using sources
    Analyzing structured data
    and much more...
