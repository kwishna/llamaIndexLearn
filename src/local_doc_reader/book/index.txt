and stay at home as much as possible.

capturing the devastation on their mobiles as cars were being swept away in the gushing water.
The Chandigarh-Manali National Highway is blocked due to landslides and flooding at multiple places.
The Shimla-Kinnaur Road is also closed for vehicular traffic due to slides and falling of rocks.
